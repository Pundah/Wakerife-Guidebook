        Just Dire Things started as a collection of random items and blocks I wanted added to the game.  Then things kind of got away from me.....

        This mod adds:
        4 Tiers of Resources, requiring exploration of the different Minecraft Dimensions to unlock.
        4 Tiers of Tools, each with unique abilities, some never before seen!
        4 Tiers of Armor, each with their own set of Unique Abilities!
        Many blocks designed around automation.  Including:
        Block Breakers/Placers
        Sensors
        Teleporters
        Energy Generator and distribution blocks.
        ```

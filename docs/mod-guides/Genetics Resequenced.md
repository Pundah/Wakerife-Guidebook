        A modern remake of the mod Genetics Reborn (which was itself a remake of Advanced Genetics)!

        With this mod, you can scrape mobs for their Genes, processing them into any of 80+ powers, and infuse them into yourself or others!
        
        Most Genes can be utilized by both players and mobs, so your pets can be as powerful as you are!
        ```

        To generate energy, Powah! adds Furnators, Magmators, Solar Panels, Thermo Generators, and of course the Reactor multiblocks!

        Powah! also adds the classic Energy Cables and Energy Cells, but also cool and unique mechanics such as the upgradable Ender Network, Player Transmitters, the Energizing crafting system, and a bunch of cool gadgets and items such as the Charged Snowball!

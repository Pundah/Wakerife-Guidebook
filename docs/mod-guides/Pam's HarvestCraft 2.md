        Welcome to the brand new HarvestCraft for 1.14.4 and beyond!  Please read carefully as this is NOT a update of Pam's HarvestCraft but a re-boot.  Pam's HarvestCraft 2 comes in four mods.  This mod adds 400+ new foods to Minecraft using the crops and fruit trees from PHC 2 - Crops and PHC 2 - Trees, allows you to create 120+ new foods (1.20 has 180+!!) for Minecraft using vanilla Minecraft ingredients (There are a few generic recipes at the bottom that will work with any fruit or vegetable in any correctly tagged mod.), adds FRUIT TREES ONLY, and adds CROPS ONLY.  I did not touch vanilla food at all.

        Farmer's Delight is a mod that gently expands upon farming and cooking in Minecraft.

        Using a simple cooking system and a few familiar ingredients, you'll be able to prepare a wide variety of hearty meals: from sandwiches to salads and stews, from beautiful desserts to mouth-watering feasts, no ingredient will be left behind in your kitchen!

        It also introduces a rich set of utilities: a way to improve the very soil your crops grow in, a brand new kind of tool to scavenge resources with, cute decorations for your builds, and many blocks and items to help you on your adventure!

        It's time to farm a little bit of everything!

        ZeroCore is a mod intended for other mod authors

        It contains code to handle the basic mechanics of the game and Forge, including:
            - handlers to process network messages on the correct thread
            - new GUI system
            - a base TileEntity implementation that simplifiy data syncronization between server and remote clients, updates and GUI handling
            - helper classes and blockstate properties to handle connected textures
            - standard configuration handler with built-in support for in-game configs changes
            - standard ore generator and re-generation
            - much more
        
        It's also the home of a revised multiblock API that support multiple client mods without performance penalities

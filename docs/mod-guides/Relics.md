        Reliсs is an easy-to-install drag-n-drop mod that adds dozens of unique items with complex and thoughtful mechanics. The true potential of each relic can be unlocked both when used alone, and in combination with other relics or even mods. When creating each relic, we took into account that modpack will not consist only of our mod, therefore the mod balance is automatically adjusted to the needs of the modpack, which makes Relics fits perfectly both in the vanilla-like modpack and modpack, where the numbers of health and damage is in the thousands.

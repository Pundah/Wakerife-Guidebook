        Productive Bees builds on the content added by Minecraft 1.15 and adds additional bees and advanced beehives allowing you to put your bees to work creating resources in a fully automated setup. Productive bees are just as derpy as their vanilla cousins, but makes up for it in usefulness and beeuty.

        This mod adds bees for most vanilla resources as well as all your favorite modded resources like copper, lead, silver etc. There are also a lot of bees for mod specific resources like Mystical Agriculture essence, Silents Gems, Powah, Tinkers Construct, Thermal and many more. In total you can find more than 200 bees if the relevant mods are installed.

        We also add up to 32 variants of a new advanced beehives for the bees to live in, most of which are made from wood added by other mods.

# Configs

Pack configs are usually located in the `config/` folder, though others may be in your `world/serverconfigs/` folder.

!!! Warning "When editing configs, please make sure server / client is not running"

    For clients, it's safe to edit `world/serverconfigs/` while not in the world and or restarting entire client.
